# Introduction to C for Python Programmers

**Instructor**: Dmitri Rozmanov (University of Calgary, Research Computing Services)

It is a good idea for any researcher who writes programming code, 
to know a least two programming languages, 
a high level powerful interpreted language to do prototyping and quick development,
and the second, a lower level fast compiled language that can be used when maximum performance 
is required for brute force computations.
What pair of languages to choose is a matter of taste and personal preference.
Perl and C, R and Fortran, or Python and C++ could be those pairs.

In this course we will overview the C and C++ programming languages and see how they relate to Python.
We will look at how C++ can be a good addition to your Python skill set and 
and why it is an especially good compimentary copmpiled language for Python.

**Target audience**: general. 

<!-- **Course plan**: -->

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: Working knowledge of Python will be required.


**Laptop software**: All attendees will need to bring their laptops with wireless access and with a
remote SSH client installed (on Windows laptops we recommend <a
