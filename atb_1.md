# Application of Data Science to Finance

**Instructor**: Gunjan Kaur (ATB Financial)

We will start with a brief introduction to various problems in the financial world. We will address the analysis and the resolution of these financial areas using big data and data science. Further using python we will dive into machine learning algorithms that can be applied to solve these problems. We will also build an end to end machine learning solution for a particular use-case (fraud detection or algorithmic trading). Next we will look at challenges that exist in deploying AI at scale and how they can be mitigated.

**Target audience**: Anyone interested in financial application of Data Science
