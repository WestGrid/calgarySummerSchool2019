# Gathering and Using Unstructured Data

**Instructor**: Tyler Dauphinee and Rhys Chouinard (ATB Financial)

A practical survey on common data gathering tasks via open APIs, web scraping, and OCR (optical character recognition). Taking advantage of some common libraries in python (requests, beautifulsoup, and tesseract/pytesseract) we will build a base competency in data gathering. We will then introduce one of the most widely used machine learning libraries (scikit-learn) and use it to model a few canonical datasets. Finally (time permitting) we will move through one end-to-end real-world modelling scenario for each of the 3 data gathering tasks (document classification, hockey bracket predictions, and movie score modelling) 

**Target audience**: Researchers who need to automate the gathering of data from scanned documents, unruly websites, or other publicly available sources.
