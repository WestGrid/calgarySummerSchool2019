# Instructions for attendees

Morning sessions will be 9:00am-12:00pm. Afternoon sessions will be 1:00pm-4:00pm. All sessions will take
place in Engineering Block G (ENG) and Engineering Block B (ENB) -- for details please see the
[program]({{ site.baseurl }}/1-program.html). The program will continue to be updated as details are
confirmed for room assignments, session times and detailed course information.

## Linux command line

Please note that most, even beginner's sessions assume a working knowledge of Linux command line. On Day
1 in the morning we will teach an introduction to Linux command line ("Bash Scripting and Tools") for
absolute beginners. If you are new to Linux, we highly recommend attending this session before any other
courses.

## Laptops

**Important**: All attendees must bring their laptops and power cords (if your battery does not last all
day). Don't forget to check details and prerequisites for each course, including software requirements
for your laptop under **Laptop software**. Please install the required software before coming to class.

## Wi-Fi access

Before the start of the summer school **all eligible attendees must obtain** their Eduroam accounts
through their home institutions. You will need online access to log in to remote systems, complete
hands-on exercises, view documentation, etc., so please make sure you can sign in to the campus WiFi. If
you are not sure how to obtain it, please contact the local IT department at your institution. There will
also be self-serve WiFi accounts.

## Cluster accounts

If you have a Compute Canada acount, you are encouraged to use it during the school. We will also be
providing guest accounts. In some of the courses you will be using a training cluster in a virtual
machine (VM), and in some courses you will be running jobs on real Compute Canada production clusters.
