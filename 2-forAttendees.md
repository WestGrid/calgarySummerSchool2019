# Instructions for attendees

Morning sessions will be 9:00am-12:00pm. Afternoon sessions will be 1:00pm-4:00pm. The sessions will take
place in rooms *(to be filled in)* -- for details please see the [program]({{ site.baseurl
}}/1-program.html).

These pages will continue to be updated as details are confirmed for room assignments, session times and
detailed course information.

**Important**: All attendees must bring their laptops and power cords (if your battery does not last all
day). Don't forget to check details and prerequisites for each course, including software requirements
for your laptop under **Laptop software**. Please install the required software before coming to class.

Before the start of the summer school **all eligible attendees must obtain** their Eduroam accounts
through their home institutions. You will need online access to log in to remote systems, complete the
hands-on exercises, view documentation, etc., so please make sure you can sign in to the campus WiFi. If
you are not sure how to obtain it, please contact the local IT department at your institution.

For this summer school we will be using a training cluster, and we will provide guest accounts to all
attendees. You don't need your Compute Canada acount for the school.
