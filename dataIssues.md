# Real data issues in Machine Learning, and how to handle them

**Instructor**: Giovane Cesar da Silva (IBM)

Typically, when someone learns Machine Learning methods, the example data sets are pre-processed and
cleaned. When working in professional projects, the state of the data is unknown and requires effort to
make it usable even for simple statistics.

In this hands-on workshop, you will:
- practice data understanding,
- ingest data with bad format,
- apply standard data quality tests,
- apply data specific quality tests, and
- use some data patching algorithms.

**Target audience**: general

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Level**: beginner to intermediate

**Prerequisites**: Knowledge of Python language, package management, and Pandas data processing.

**Laptop software**: All attendees will need to bring laptops with wireless access with Anaconda 2019.03
installed and updated and configured in your preferred IDE.
